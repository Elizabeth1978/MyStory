   <h1>My story</h1>

<p>MY NAME IS ELIZABETH BEKELE THIS IS MY STORY</p>

<p>My experience with computers was challenging but in a good way. When I was 16 years old I was learning a computer in the trailing center. It was challenging because 1 desktop for 2 or 3 students .
I was learning Office Administration Management and at the same time I was taking a Clinical nurse assistant and working on it.
I started working at the Government  office as a full time employee in my country so I have a personal computer and an office computer. I have been working for more than 6  years in different positions and all of them required using a computer.
Therefore ,  I joined Refcode and I am excited and  happy for this chance to ring the change.</p>
